      <description>Work in ProgressThis page is a current topic of research, some things may not be accurate.AuthorAlessa &amp;#34;Codekitten&amp;#34; BakerPage StatusWIPWorkflow There are a couple of paths that Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s render pipeline can be extended - Scene View Extensions, Virtual Shader Paths to externally write shaders and include them in material Custom Nodes, or modifying the existing ush/usf files of the engine as an Engine Modification.
I have spent quite a lot of time attempting to figure out the best general workflow when extending Unreal Engine&amp;rsquo;s rendering pipeline, but all of them benefit from some additional parameters that can be enabled in ini files.</description>

      <description>Articles found here are parts of the Unreal Rendering Architecture that can be called and used directly within Plugins. I will be developing with this in mind, but considering how easy Plugin architecture is in Unreal, this can be placed within Engine/Plugins also.
In general, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to always attempt to write anything in Unreal that does not require engine modification as a plugin, this is a recommendation by Epic as making the engine modular is generally the best approach.</description>

      <description>AuthorAlessa &amp;#34;Codekitten&amp;#34; BakerPage StatusCompleteWhat is a Shading Model? A shading model simply describes how a given surface renders a pixel depending on lighting, camera direction, and the surface.
If you are familiar with regularly creating Unlit materials, you are likely trying to do something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow Unreal&amp;rsquo;s PBR (GGX) implementation and trying to remove or add your own lighting to better calculate your material&amp;rsquo;s aesthetic.
This unfortunately leads to the limitation of having to use Material Parameter Collections, Dynamic Material Instances, attempting to implement in a Post Process Material or Mesh Custom Data to pass in the lighting and can get quite tedious (and expensive) to implement.</description>
